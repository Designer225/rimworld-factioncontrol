  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Faction Control"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 12/15/2017
	- Initial release (spun off from "Configurable Maps").
	- The "total number of factions" slider now has a minimum setting of 0 rather
	  than 3. So, yes, you can create a world with no faction bases at all.
	- Added a "faction base density" slider to allow you to set how densely the
	  world is populated with faction bases.
	- The number of factions which start out hostile to the player now scales
	  upward with the total number of factions on the map.
	- Vanilla factions now have wider ranges of "starting goodwill" options, so
	  their initial feelings about the player faction (and other factions, too)
	  will vary more.
	- If you create a world with no hostile factions on the map, mechanoids will
	  be able to show up as raiders from the very beginning of the game. (Even if
	  you have disallowed mechanoids, this still applies, as mechanoids will
	  always be available for raids in the absence of other hostile factions.)

- 12/17/2017
	- There should no longer be any chance of faction bases being stacked on top
	  of each other on tile 0 (at the very middle of the world map).
	- If you choose to group faction bases geographically, pirate factions will
	  now be more diffuse, with bases overlapping territory otherwise held by the
	  more "nationalistic" factions, since pirate factions are less interested in
	  holding territory than in raiding it.
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.

- 12/22/2017
	- The mod now dynamically creates settings options for any factions added by
	  mods, so you have the same control over those factions that you have over
	  vanilla factions.
	- A "nation building" slider has replaced the "group factions" toggle, so you
	  can decide just how geographically constrained the various faction groups'
	  bases should be.
	- If all factions are disabled, you'll simply have a planet with no faction
	  bases, even if the "minimum faction count" is set higher than 0. No more
	  defaulting to a planet full of pirates.
	- Further refined the base placement logic.

- 12/23/2017
	- Added Japanese language translation files provided by Proxyer.

- 12/24/2017
	- Fixed the faction base density slider so it works as it's supposed to. (The
	  density was accidentally being influenced by faction count, meaning that in
	  games with a lot of faction mods, far more bases were being generated than
	  should have been.)
	- For the benefit of those who liked the insanely overpopulated worlds that
	  the mod was generating, I added an "insane" setting to the faction density
	  slider.

- 12/31/2017
	- Added a "young warrior" pawn kind with a weaker combat strength, in order
	  to allow tribal factions to be usable for early (35 point) raids. Without
	  them, in games using only tribal factions, early raids simply weren't
	  being generated.
	- Updated the Japanese translation files.
